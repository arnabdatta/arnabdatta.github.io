Durga Puja, undoubtedly one of the biggest, most artistic festival of Bengal and India celebrated over hundred of years. Though most of the people do pandal hopping in Kolkata city, many people like me like to enjoy less crowded places, enjoy 'Kash Phool' in vast paddy field and experience 'Bonedi Bari' puja at villages of Bengal. In this blog post I will give you a guide of going to some of the old Pujo of Bengal Village which you can cover comfortably in one day. I didn't find a good blog for this, that why decided to write one for you all.

I am taking the starting point as New Town, we will mainly cover Dankuni, Janai, Piyasara and Sarkar Bari. I will also include the google maps link, so it will be easy to navigate.

Here are the Pujos we will cover.

1. Garalgacha Jamidar Bari (Locally known as Babuder Bari) - Near Dankuni
2. Janai Gola Bari
3. Piyasara Sarkar Bari
