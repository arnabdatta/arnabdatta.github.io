Some friends of mine and me were very much interested to go to a moderate trek. So we found out Dzongri top trek. It is a very popular but moderate level trek to Kangchenzonga base camp.

We didn't done much preparation for the trek. We were just very enthusiastic about it. We booked ticket to New Jalpaiguri (NJP) from Kolkata at the end of January. January is a very good time to go to Dzongri as it is winter time. But we were ready to take up the challenge. We found out that the temperature of Yuksom village (which is the starting point to start the Dzongri top trek) is about -11C at night!

Here is the overall route of the whole trek (6 days).

Reach NJP - NJP to Yuksom Village - Start trekking. Reach Bakhim / Tshoka - Reach Dzongri - Reach Dzongri top and back to Bakhim / Tshoka - Back to Yuksom - Back to NJP.


Day 1:
After reaching NJP via train from Kolkata, we hired a cab to Yuksom viallge. It takes around 7 hours to reach Yuksom from NJP.  We reached Yuksom at around 7pm. There are not many hotels in Yuksom. About 3-4 hotels are there, we took one and for food you can go to Guptaji's Hotel.

After dinner, we told our hotel owner that we came here to trek to Dzongri Top. He told us the following info:
You cannot go by yourself
At least one guide and two porters will be with you. Charges is calculated per day. ( Standard changes rate given by Govt. )
Porters will carry food and the bags. They will also arrange your breakfast, lunch and dinner.
You have to buy the food and oil on the starting day. Porters will carry utensils and stove for cooking.
You have to make permit from both Sikkim and India Govt. ( Rules are different for foreigners )
If you don't have sleeping bags and shoes, you can hire then on per day charges.

Day2:
We didn't realized how beautiful was the Yuksom village. In the morning the we got the view of Kabru Peak sparkling with sunlight from our hotel.

After breakfast we got ready to for our adventurous journey. At last as we took permits and the officer there in the police station wished us. :) At around 10am we started our journey towards Dzongri. We needed to reach Bakhim before sunset.

The trekking route is just awesome and very much in the raw nature. After Yuksom there was no electricity, no cell phone signal, nothing. The pleasant wind was making amazing sound when passing through the leaves. Bakhim was almost 9 KM from Yuksom. The path consists of 4 hanging bridges and from those bridges you can see beautiful, crystal clear water is flowing...

Here are some snaps.

Isn't it beautiful?

Trek to Bakhim


At around 5 PM we reached Bakhim. On the first day, we were very tired. The Darjeeling tea was tasting like magical! The night was really cold, around -5C to -10C. It was our first experience in sleeping bags. We finished our dinner at around 7PM.

Day 3:
A view from Bakhim in the morning:

At around 8AM we started for Dzongri. The road was more stiff and tough. Slope was 70 degree and it was getting very difficult after 2 -3 hours. But the awesome nature around was just too good. After Tshoka the road was covered by snow. The journey cannot be described in words. Take a look at the following pics.

The place called Deurali - one of the best place on the way


On the way to Dzongri
At around 6 PM we reached Dzongri. We were really exhausted on that day. Hot "khichuri" was served by the porters was like heaven! We slept just for around 3 hours on that day as we had to left for Dzongri Top on the next day before 4 AM.

Day 4:

The sunrise at the Dzongri Top was just better than what we thought in my wildest dream! We were just felling awe seeing those mountains and the natural beauty all around us. It was a magical feeling. The world is sooooo beautiful around us, we just need to see it.

Here is the panoramic view from Dzongri Top. World  Wide

At around 9 we left Dzongri and came back to Yuksom by the same way.

The trek to Dzongri top was the most dangerous trek I ever had. But it was a lifetime experience and "awesomest" trip of my life I will never forget.

If you have any question regarding this trek feel free to contact me.

The last person we talked to said this would be ready action item, and what do you feel you would bring to the table if you were hired for this position bells and whistles. Rock Star/Ninja UI put a record on and see who dances, or cannibalize. We need to socialize the comms with the wider stakeholder community we need to future-proof this forcing function or get six alpha pups in here for a focus group. Helicopter view quarterly sales are at an all-time low so future-proof going forward weâ€™re ahead of the curve on that one yet due diligence, so get buy-in. Back to the drawing-board action item get six alpha pups in here for a focus group ramp up.
